                <h1>Aizen's Espada</h1>
                <small>Espada Number 4</small>
                <p>The Espada are comprised of ten Arrancar with exemplary strength. Members of the Espada are given a number from 0-9. The lower the number, the more Reiryoku the Espada has. Each Espada has a tattoo with their number somewhere on them, such as Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez, whose tattoo is on his lower back, and Coyote Starrk, whose tattoo is on the back of his left hand. Along with Sōsuke Aizen, Gin Ichimaru, and Kaname Tōsen, the Espada as a group possess comparable strength to Soul Society's Gotei 13 Shinigami captains.

                    Their immense amount of power and leadership status among the Arrancar also grants each Espada the authority to exert command over Aizen's other forces within Las Noches: the Números, the Exequias,and their own Fracción, chosen by them from the Números. Similar to the power gap between captains and lieutenants in the Gotei 13, the strength of the Espada far surpasses that of the average Número. Aizen himself is confident enough in his Espada's abilities to send them out on potentially hazardous missions, such as gathering information in the Human World, fighting Shinigami captains inside Las Noches and Karakura Town by themselves, and searching for Vasto Lorde.</p>

                    <h3>Ulquiorra Cifer</h3>

                    <img src="https://dreager1.files.wordpress.com/2013/04/ulquiorra-ulquiorra-schiffer-30663104-1600-925.jpg?w=640" alt="ulquiorra" />
                    <p>Ulquiorra is an extremely cold and callous individual with a very brooding and indifferent attitude, willing to kill both enemies and comrades that get in his way. He refers to anyone he finds uninteresting as trash, fully expendable but is not extremely violent unlike other Espada. Ulquiorra does not believe in human emotions, which he calls the "heart" and reasons if he can't see it, it doesn't exist. His unfriendly attitude lets him stay completely calm and he is never easily surprised or caught off guard. Ulquiorra doesn't comprehend a human's trait of fighting even against all odds as seen when he angrily shouted at Ichigo "that continuing to fight is pointless".

                        He is also shown to have an extremely knowledgeable and cunning personality, demonstrating the ability to easily figure out how a person's powers work. Ulquiorra seems somewhat demanding as well, seen when he made Orihime eat a meal brought to her, even threatening to force food down her throat or strap her down and feed her via IV. This shows that while Ulquiorra doesn't like getting his hands dirty, he's capable of doing inhumane things without any remorse. Unlike most other Arrancar, he accepted death, while most others died cursing their enemies or showing fear of death. Ulquiorra also very rarely changes his facial expression, keeping a very melancholic expression most of the time.</p>
